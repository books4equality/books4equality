                Books 4 Equality is a free library with an online database for anyone to search, view, and borrow real books from. We solicit donations from all kinds of books in usable condition, then lend them to colege students. Catering towards making college more affordable for students, we have a strong presence and continue to grow on college campuses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some older & out-of-date books will be donated to schools, libraries, and other organizations around the world.

            <p class="lead"> <strong>Philosophy</strong><br></p>
            <p>Books4Equality strives to decrease the cost of college. Our principles are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Affordability.</strong> The cost of textbooks have increased by 82% in the last decade. Today, students are spending an average of <strong>$1,200</strong> in books and supplies per year. With Books4Equality, your bills will be reduced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Equality.</strong> 65% of students decide against buying a textbook because of the price. With Books4Equality, the cost of the classes will not stop you from taking that extra class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sustainability.</strong> Reducing the carbon footprint. The CO<sub>2</sub> emmissions from the production of textbooks used by UVM students each year is equivalent to the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by a car travelling to the moon and back. 
                </li>

            <p>
                One day, while walking through campus, we noticed a large amount of books on a table that someone didnâ€™t want. A conversation ensued about the incredible amount of money we had all paid for textbooks over our time at college, and how the majority were only used for that one class. An idea was born, and now we are looking for students to get behind it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class='jumbotron' id="situation">
            <p class="lead"> <strong>The Situation</strong><br></p>
            <p>
                The skyrocketing cost of textbooks has caused students to spend on average of $1,200 per year on books alone. This has forced many students to buy or rent used books. Or as one study showed, 65% of students had forgone buying the book altogether, despite 94% claiming they were concerned that not having the book would negatively affect their grades. Furthermore, it was shown that students were choosing which classes and the number of classes they took based textbook prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is creating an educational inequality in American colleges and universities that we believe it is time to change. Books4Equality has been collecting hundreds of books from the University of Vermont since August of 2014. Professors and students alike have expressed interest and enthusiasm in helping the idea of the creation of a <strong>free textbook library</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are 4,000 colleges and universities in the US, with 21 million students enrolled in the Fall 2014. Each year, college students spend an average of $1,200 on textbooks. This is set accompanied by over <strong>$1 trillion in student loan debt</strong>. Textbook prices can be as high as 39% of tuition and fees at community colleges and 14% at four-year public institutions. Over the past decade, textbook prices have increased by 82%, which is three times the rate of inflation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With these increasing costs, students are being deterred from physically purchasing their required books due to financial restraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is creating a clear education gap in the American collegiate system. Students who are able to expensibe books are doing better than those who don't have the money. The students who can't afford these books are forced to incur more debt, work longer hours, or make choices that undermine their academic progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                As publishers continue to drive up the cost of new editions, students are turning to other means, such as purchasing used copies, settling for previous editions, or renting. As students purchase fewer new editions, publishers raise prices even more to regain lost profit. This creates a vicious cycle of economic despair. "Students are paying too much for textbooks, plain and simple," said Ethan Senack, a higher education associate at U.S. PIRG, in a call with reporters. "The textbooks market is broken and students are paying the price." Books4Equality is the way to fix the system.
